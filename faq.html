            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">1. What does the treatment process at Skinity involve?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    At Skinity, every step is designed to ensure safe, transparent, and personalised care. Our goal is for you to feel informed, confident, and supported throughout your journey.

                    <div class="step-title">Step 1: Free Online Assessment</div>
                    Your first contact is through a free online assessment with a qualified professional. During this session, we explore your aesthetic concerns, medical history, and goals. Based on this, we recommend the most suitable treatments, clearly explaining their benefits, limitations, and realistic expectations.
                    You will also be guided with pre-treatment care instructions to ensure you arrive fully prepared for your in-person appointment.

                    <div class="step-title">Step 2: Informed Consent & Appointment Scheduling</div>
                    If you decide to proceed, you will be sent an informed consent document detailing the proposed treatment - its purpose, method, possible risks, contraindications, side effects, and aftercare.
                    This document should be carefully reviewed and digitally signed. Only after receiving the signed consent can your in-person appointment be confirmed.

                    <div class="step-title">Step 3: In-Person Treatment Session</div>
                    On the scheduled day, you will be welcomed in a safe, fully compliant clinical environment. A thorough facial assessment will be performed, and any questions or concerns will be fully addressed prior to the treatment.
                    The procedure will be performed with technical precision, focusing on facial harmony, using high-quality medical products, always aiming for subtle, safe, and natural-looking results.
                    At the end, you will receive personalised aftercare instructions to optimise your results and minimise any side effects.

                    <div class="step-title">Step 4: Ongoing Support & Follow-Up</div>
                    After your treatment, you will have direct access to the clinic for any questions or concerns. We may also contact you for a post-treatment review, and if clinically indicated, you can schedule a complimentary follow-up appointment.

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">2. Are treatments suitable for those who have never had aesthetic procedures before?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Yes.</strong> All treatments are customised to your individual needs and expectations. First-time clients receive clear, informed guidance at every stage to ensure safety and confidence.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">3. How do I know which treatment is right for me?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    During your <strong>free online assessment</strong>, we assess your concerns, medical history, and aesthetic goals to recommend the safest and most effective treatment options to achieve natural and balanced results.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">4. What are the most common treatments at Skinity?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Our most popular procedures include:
                    <br><strong>• Botulinum toxin (Botox®)</strong> for expression lines on the forehead, glabella, and crow's feet
                    <br><strong>• Skinboosters</strong> for deep hydration and improved skin texture
                    <br><strong>• Facial microneedling</strong> to stimulate collagen and even out skin tone
                    <br><strong>• Dermal fillers</strong> to enhance volume, define lips, or soften smile lines
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">5. How long do the results last?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Duration varies by treatment and individual metabolism, but generally:
                    <br><strong>• Botox:</strong> 3 to 4 months
                    <br><strong>• Skinboosters:</strong> 4 to 6 months
                    <br><strong>• Microneedling:</strong> progressive results visible after 3 to 6 sessions
                    <br><strong>• Dermal fillers:</strong> typically 6 to 12 months, depending on the product and area treated
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">6. Can treatments be combined in the same session?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Yes,</strong> if clinically safe. For example, Botox and skinboosters can be done on the same day, but Botox and microneedling should not be combined. This will be carefully planned based on your needs and safety.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">7. Is there any downtime after treatments?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Most procedures require <strong>little to no downtime.</strong> You may experience slight redness, swelling, or minor bruising at injection sites, which usually resolves within a few days. You will receive specific aftercare instructions.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">8. Are the treatments painful?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Discomfort varies, but treatments are <strong>generally well tolerated.</strong> Very fine needles are used, and local anaesthetic can be applied when necessary to minimise any discomfort.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">9. Will Botox results leave me looking "frozen"?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>No.</strong> Our approach focuses on subtle, balanced results that preserve your natural facial expressions. The goal is to soften lines while maintaining your unique identity. You will still look like yourself - just more refreshed and rested.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">10. Are treatments suitable for men?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Absolutely.</strong> All treatments are suitable for men and women. Many male clients choose Botox, skinboosters, or microneedling to improve skin texture, reduce wrinkles, and refresh their appearance discreetly and naturally.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">11. Is a deposit required to book a consultation?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Yes.</strong> A small deposit is requested to secure your appointment, which will be deducted from the final treatment cost.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">12. Are there any hidden fees or consultation charges?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>No.</strong> The online assessment is free, and all pricing is communicated transparently before booking.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">13. I have had aesthetic treatments elsewhere - can I continue treatment at Skinity?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Yes.</strong> Your previous treatment history will be carefully reviewed during your assessment. In some cases, a waiting period or treatment adjustment may be recommended to ensure safety and optimal results.
